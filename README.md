# Python-Optimisation-Project

The projetc is credited to Udemy Course:Power System Economic Dispatch: Python Model & Optimization (https://www.udemy.com/course/economic-dispatch/), which I enrolled to develop and practise Optimisation Libraries.

## Project brief
The project tries to find the optimal power generation for each power plants (four power plants(CO2), one wind farm and one power storage unit) while minimising total generation cost by using optimisation package "Pyomo"(https://www.pyomo.org/)
